In the past decade or so, we've been hearing more and more about data, everywhere from our academic and professional lives to our personal lives. Data is an unavoidable and inescapable aspect of our lives, especially as those lives unfold, increasingly, online. These considerations may feel overwhelming on the surface, but, rather than fear or fight data itself, we can be empowered through the use of powerful, open source tools created to help us get a handle on the data we inevitably collect in order to use it in meaningful and equitable ways. *R* is one of these tools; it is a powerful programming language and environment in which users can arrange and analyze data through statistical computing. 

While *R* and its development environment, *RStudio*, are free to access and use, there's a not insignificant learning curve to overcome in order to understand and use it efficiently for your own work and research. Forunately, that's what Geneseo's [Center for Digital Learning](https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl) is here for!

In this workshop, you'll learn about we will interactively use the command-line within the R console to navigate through the typical workflow of importing and preparing data to summarizing and visualizing data. Along the way, we'll experiment with validation, merging, recoding, and aggregation techniques.

A few modifications have been made to tailor the content to our Geneseo community.

## Why *R*?

One time while searching the internet looking for some help on how to use a specific function in *R*, I came across a webpage with the header: "I think, therefore I *R*." I enjoy the play on words, and even more, the sentiment of *thinking* about data. Popular statistical software alternatives tend to emphasize a preset interface rather than a flexible environment. Although such programs provide an attractive graphical user interface with an impressive assortment of pre-definied functions, navigation often involves traversing layer upon layer of menus and pop-up windows, which can be both limiting and frustrating!

While it is a natural instinct to look at data in a spreadsheet format, and it is convenient to have pre-defined analyses and graphs, a great deal of understanding comes from the actual process of exploring data, from recurrently asking questions and receiving immediate feedback within a single environment. In this way, the process is just as (and in some cases, perhaps more) important than the result. In *R* we can quickly and easily generate statisics, create visualizations and interact with the data in a flexible and dynamic way. In the following lessons, we will explore a variety of functions that will help us to get started. Beyond this workshop, I encourage you to conduct web searches to look for functions that are designed to help you achieve your data management, analysis, and visualization goals. There is a very large and growing community of *R* users that is eager to help, and along the way you will inevitably learn more about the underlying logic and ways in which functions can be customized to suit your analysis needs!
